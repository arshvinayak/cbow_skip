In a primary care clinic, the physician reviews symptoms, medical history, and vital signs
before ordering a complete blood count and lipid profile. The nurse records blood
pressure, oxygen saturation, and temperature, then updates the electronic health
record. Based on lab results, the doctor adjusts medication dosage and schedules
follow-up. Patient counselling focuses on diet, adherence, side effects, and early
warning signs.
